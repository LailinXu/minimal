## Introduction

The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC is yet another remarkable achievement of the Standard Model.
At the same time we know that the SM has to be just an effective field theory, since it cannot provide explanations to various experimental observations
such as the neutrino masses and oscillations, the existence of dark matter and the
large baryon asymmetry present in the Universe. Moreover, fine tuning arguments such as the
naturalness of the electroweak (EW) scale, the large hierarchy among the Yukawa couplings
also seem to suggest that an ultraviolet completion of this theory is needed.

This paradigm has motivated in the last decades a huge experimental effort for the direct search for New Physics.
